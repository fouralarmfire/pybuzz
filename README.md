# PyBuzz - Fizzbuzz in Python

### version 1
This is my first tested script in Python so this is more about learning to use Python's built-in testing framework,
unittest, than finding the quickest way to do something. Therefore, although I know there are other, shorter, probably cleaner ways of doing PyBuzz, I've taken
the longer route just so that I would have to write more tests and follow the red->green->refactor circle.


### version 2
The quick/short one
